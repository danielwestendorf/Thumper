Thumper
=======

Thumper is now open source! Sandworms kept wrecking my home.

Personally, I've moved on to iTunes Match. Thus, I'm not the right one to lead this product any longer. I'm looking for someone
to take over the project.

Thumper is written with MacRuby.

Feel free to FORK and manipulate as you see fit!
